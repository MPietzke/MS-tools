# shiny msp-Viewer

This is a small app intended to inspect mass spectra (msp) files, without the usage of NISTMS or similar tools.
 
It runs in R, just open the file in R-Studio, make sure it has the required packages installed (shiny, shinythemes, tidyverse, plotly) and press the "Run App" button.
Then upload a msp file using the "browse" button. 
The uploaded msp file can be exported for further processing as a table on csv format. Further the mass spectra can be inspected using this tool.
